# charts: A Helm charts server

Charts is a simple charts server. This service might be deployed in the same way as all charts services.

The `templates/` directory contains a charts deployment/service/ingress with parameters.

The `values.yaml` file contains the default values for the
`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml` and `ingress.yaml` templates.
